# CommonMark conformance

The parser is checked against the
[CommonMark 0.31.2 specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/)'s own
examples on every CI run.

| | Examples |
|---|---|
| Pass | **530 of 652** |
| Raw HTML passed through unchanged — not supported | 70 |
| Indented code blocks — not supported | 46 |
| Deliberate leniencies, below | 6 |

Leave out the two features the package does not support, and 530 of the 536
remaining examples pass. Every failure is listed, with its reason, in
`test/commonmark_spec/known_failures.json`. The list is a ratchet: an example
on it that starts passing fails the run until it is taken off, so a fixed
example can never silently break again.

## How it is measured

The parser produces a tree, not HTML. `test/commonmark_spec/html_writer.dart`
writes the tree the way the reference renderer would, and both sides go
through the spec's own normalisation (`normalize.py`, ported to Dart) before
they are compared. The package's own syntax — maths, citations, footnotes,
tables, task items — prints as tags the spec never expects, so an example
that wrongly produces one fails rather than passing by accident.

```sh
flutter test test/commonmark_spec
```

## What is not supported

**Indented code blocks.** CommonMark makes a block indented four spaces into
code. Models indent prose — a continuation under a list item, a wrapped
quote — far more often than they mean code, and they fence real code. Here a
line indented four or more is text: it continues a paragraph, and at the
start of a block it is parsed like any other line.

**Raw HTML.** CommonMark passes HTML through to the browser. A Flutter
renderer has no browser, so tags are either understood (the allowlist below)
or shown as text. Raw HTML support is planned for 2.0.

## Leniencies

Each one keeps a pattern models write constantly rendering the way its
author meant.

| Input | Here | CommonMark | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| `**Note:**text`, `**粗体：**中文` | bold | literal `**` | 380, 392 |
| `[doc](My File.pdf)` | a link | literal text | 41, 488, 508 |
| `1. Step` then `  - detail` or `  1. sub-step` (two spaces) | a nested list | a separate list | 297 |

A `  2.` two spaces in, with no sub-list started, stays a sibling. Only runs
of two or more `*` are lenient; a single `*` follows the spec, so
`2 * 3 * 4` and `a*"b"*` stay as written. A destination with spaces is a
link only when the text in brackets is not a defined reference, which then
wins.

## HTML

Tags the parser understands map onto nodes it already has. Anything else —
and any tag that is not closed — stays text, so `the <b> tag` reads as
written.

A closing tag belongs to the nearest opening tag before it, so in
`The <b> tag makes <b>text bold.</b>` the second `<b>` is bold and the first
reads as written. A browser would bold everything from the first `<b>` on;
here a tag only mentioned in prose never restyles the rest of a reply. A tag
whose content is raw — `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<pre>`, `<script>`, `<svg>` —
ends at its first closing tag.

| HTML | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `<b>`, `<strong>` | bold |
| `<i>`, `<em>`, `<cite>`, `<var>` | italic |
| `<s>`, `<del>`, `<strike>` | strikethrough |
| `<u>`, `<ins>` | underline |
| `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, `<tt>` | inline code; the content is not Markdown |
| `<sup>`, `<sub>` | superscript, subscript (`ScriptStyle`) |
| `<mark>` | highlighted (`HighlightStyle`) |
| `<br>` | a line break — in a table cell too |
| `<a href="…" title="…">` | a link |
| `<img src="…" alt="…" width="…" height="…">` | an image |
| `<span>`, `<small>`, `<big>`, `<abbr>`, `<q>`, `<font>` | their content |
| `<h1>`…`<h6>` starting a block | a heading |
| `<blockquote>` starting a block | a quote of the Markdown inside |
| `<pre>`, `<pre><code class="language-x">` starting a block | a code block |
| `<table>` with `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<caption>` (`colspan`, `rowspan`, `align`, `text-align` understood) | a table; cells merge across columns and rows, rows in `<thead>` or of `<th>` cells are header rows, and a table with neither has no header |
| `<svg>…</svg>`, on its own lines or inside a line | a drawing, sized by `width`, `height` and `viewBox`; `fill="currentColor"` takes the text colour. Shown once its `</svg>` arrives; nothing is fetched |
| `<ul>`, `<ol start>` with `<li>` | a list; Markdown and nested lists inside items work |
| `<input type="checkbox" checked>` | a checkbox — a task item inside `<li>` |
| `<div>`, `<p>`, `<center>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<section>`, … on lines of their own | dropped; the Markdown inside renders |
| `<hr>` on a line of its own | a rule |
| `<script>`, `<style>`, `<iframe>`, … when closed | hidden with their content |
| `<!-- comment -->` | hidden |

Every row can be changed — a builder for a tag of your own, a new meaning
for a built-in one, or HTML off altogether. See
[HTML tags](custom-components.md#html-tags). Out of the box `<details>` renders
open; a few lines of `htmlTags` make it a collapsible.

Not understood yet, so text unless you register them: tables nested in a
cell (their cells join the outer table), `<dl>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<picture>`, MathML, `<ruby>`, and
form controls other than a checkbox.

## Where it differs from the reference output, by design

These pass the spec — they are noted because they read differently from a
browser:

* **Line breaks.** A single newline inside a paragraph is shown as a line
  break, not folded into a space. Models write short lines and lists of
  glyphs that read wrong folded. Two trailing spaces or a trailing `\` are
  hard breaks (`MdLineBreak`) as in CommonMark, and look the same.
* **`\(…\)` and `\[…\]` are maths** when they enclose a formula. Unpaired, or
  around nothing but punctuation, they are the escaped brackets CommonMark
  says they are. A formula still streaming in is closed or held by the
  streaming view before it reaches the parser.
